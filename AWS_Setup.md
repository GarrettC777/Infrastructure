# AWS Setup

For our project, we decided to use a single person's account, and add the rest of us as authorized users.

In order to do this, we needed to complete a number of steps.

**1)** Firstly, we opened the **IAM Console**, and navigated to **Users**.

**2)** Once the page loaded, we chose **Add User**.

**3)** We setup all of our user accounts the same way:

**Type of Access:** Programmatic + AWS Management

**Console Password:** Auto-generated Password

**Require Password Reset:** Yes

**Set Permissions:** Add user to Group (TheGroup)

**4)** We then downloaded the Access Keys and Secret Keys, and used a USB drive to send each other the credentials.
