	<h2 id="Tasks">Tasks</h2>
		<p>Below are a set of tasks that need to be completed for Project 0. 
		   There are both individual (I) and team (T) based tasks. 
		</p>

		<h3>Build a Team (T)<h3/>
			<p>You will need to create a team of 3 – 4 people preferably. 
			   Once you have found your team members, you will need to come up with a team name. 
			   Finally, you will need to let the professor know the members of your team and it’s name. 
			</p> 

		<h3>GitHub (I)</h3> 
			<p>Git is a popular distributed version control system (DVCS) that allow a group of users to work together
			   on a common set of code. We will be using git as part of this class so it will be helpful to learn about
			   it as quickly as possible. You should have git installed locally on your computer and it should be used
			   to track the work you do with your team. 
			</p>
			   
			<p>GitHub is an online platform that allow people around the world to work on projects together. 
			   We will be utilizing GitHub in this course to track team work. You will need to sign up for a 
			   GitHub account (free).
			</p> 
			
			<p>GitHub offers additional extra resources such as an issue/task tracker and a peer review system 
			   for changes made (pull requests). We will discuss this in more depth during class. 
			</p>

			<p>It is also suggested that you sign up for the GitHub Student Developer pack. This provides you with
   			   a set of free and discounted software tools that can be useful in future endeavors. 
			   https://education.github.com/pack 
			</p>

		<h3>Amazon Web Services Account (I)</h3>
			<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) will be used during this course. AWS allows us to create a professional and public
			   environment with little overhead. Each member of the team will create their own account. AWS Educate is a 
			   program that gives students a $100 credit to use when learning AWS. We will combine these credits together
			   in this course so that the projects are free. 
			</p>

			<p>You will need to create a full account and not use an AWS starter account. This will require each member of 
			   team to have a credit card for initial creation. You can also use a pre-paid credit card if you prefer. 
			</p>

			<p>You will be sent a code that can be used to redeem a $100 credit for AWS. You can hold onto this code and 
			   apply all of them to a single account. It is up to the group. If each person applies this to their account, 
		       you will need to look into an AWS Organization so that you can chain together all of the accounts. 
		    </p> 
		   
		<h3>Slack (I)</h3>
			<p>Your team can use Slack to communicate about work that needs to be done. You should join the #cit480-sat 
			   channel and you can create another channel for you group. Please don't make these channels private groups
		       and do not share secrets inside of slack.
		    </p>

		     <p>Also note that this Slack is free so there is no long term history. You should keep track of important 
		        conversations you have in a different medium too for longevity. 
		     </p>
		   
		<h3>Leader of the Project</h3>
			<p>One member of the team should be appointed the "leader" for this project. This leader should change for each
			   project between the different members of the group. The lead is responsible for making sure that work is 
		       completed by other members in a timely manner. The lead will also need to work on other aspects of the 
		       project but must also keep track of everything that is happening. The lead will need to coordinate work as 
		       it is done. 
		    </p>

	<h2 id="PT">Project Tasks</h2>
		<p>These tasks are specific to Project 0 and will result in the graded material.</p> 

		<p>You will need to break down the different steps below add a set of issues in your repo on GitHub for each task 
		   and assign them to members of the team. Team members should track progress in these issues and attach them to 
		   pull requests if applicable. Issues can work as a log that tracks the work done over the past week. 
		</p>
	   
		<h3>Purchase a Domain (T)</h3>
			<p>will need to purchase a public domain for your team to use for the course. A domain name is something like 
			   csun.edu or google.com. You can use any Top-level Domain (TLD) that you'd like as these tend to be cheaper. 
		       Ideally, the domain name your choose should allow the professor to easily identify which team owns it. 
			</p>

			<p>NameCheap is a domain registrar that allows you to search for your preferred domain name. It also has deals 
		       where you can get a domain name for as little as $0.99 for a year. 
			</p> 
		   
		<h3>Setup AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)</h3>
			<p>An AWS VPC allows every organization to setup one or more networks inside of AWS. You should be given a 
			   default VPC with a given subnet (Usually 172.31.0.0/16). You will need to break these networks into public 
			   and private subnetworks to allow services in AWS to function properly. 
			</p>

			<p style="margin-left:2%; margin-right:2%;">
			Design your network so that there are the following subnets:<br>
				●	3 public subnets in 3 different availability zones (AZ) with at least 1024 available IP addresses per subnet.<br>
				●	3 private subnets in 3 different availability zones (AZ) with at least 4096 available IP addresses per subnet.<br>
				●	1 route table for the public subnets<br>
				●	1 route table for the private subnets<br>
				●	1 Internet Gateway (IG) attached to the default route of the public subnet routing table<br>
			</p>
		
		<h3>Setup a Web Server on AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)</h3>
		    <p>AWS Elastic Compute Cloud allows us to easily create virtual machines (VM), referred to as instances in AWS, 
			   with a base OS image (Amazon Machine Image or AMI). There are different types of instances that define the number
		       of vCPU cores, RAM and storage are provided by default. Instances are currently charged for by the second but when
		       looking up the price you will see it provided for each hour of service the instance uses. 
			</p>

			<p>You will need to choose the OS that you'd like to use as well as the web server that will be serving up your pages.</p>

			<p>You also need to think of a secure way to allow all users to access your machine while not sharing credentials 
			   (see task below). You should look at the EC2 Userdata service and the cloud-init process on most machines. You 
		       should be able to determine a way to provide SSH access without the use of passwords. All users can still use the
		       default account provided on the system. 
			</p>
		   
		<h3>Setup your Domain</h3>
			<p>You domain should use AWS Route53 to serve requests. You will need to setup the provider you purchased your domain 
			   from point to your domain on the Route53 servers. You will need to setup the following records in AWS Route53 that 
			   will all be served from your webserver. 
			</p>

			<p style="margin-left:2%; margin-right:2%;">
				●	Apex domain <br>
			    ●	www.<yourdomain> <br>
			</p>
		
		<h3>Generate TLS Certificates</h3>
	        <p>It is important to protect users to any website by encrypting traffic to and from it. We do this using 
			   Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates. For a long time, buying a TLS certificate was very expensive 
		       but recent efforts have made these certificates free. One such project that has helped this is called Let's Encrypt.
			   Let's Encrypt will allow the owner of a domain to verify ownership and be able to get a TLS certificate for free. 
			</p>

			<p>You must generate a set of security certificates for your domain that will work for each of the DNS addresses 
		       mentioned in the section "Setup your Domain". A single certificate should be used for all of the addresses. 
			</p>

			<p>The private key of your TLS certificate should be kept secret and not shared with anyone outside of your group 
		       to ensure that your users are protected. You must determine a safe and effective way to store and protect your 
		       certificates while also making them available to your instance to use. You can look at other AWS services such 
		       as the Secret Store to help with this. 
			</p>

		<h3>Ansible Playbook</h3>
			<p>As you have seen in previous labs Ansible is a configuration management tool and can be used to setup and configure 
		       a server. 
			</p>

			<p>Create an Ansible playbook that should install a web server and you may use either Apache or Nginx. In addition to 
		       installing the web server you should have a generic .html page that shows your team name and list the members of 
		       your group. Write a readme.md page that describes what the playbook is used for and how to execute the playbook. 
			</p>

			<p>This is a great place to use Ansible to configure user’s setup. You could write a playbook that will create users 
		       and copy their public ssh keys. 
			</p>
		   
	<h2 id="TB">Task Breakdown</h2>
	    <p>You will need to break down all of your tasks into a set of issues inside of GitHub. These tasks should be 
		   broken down into subtasks as needed and assigned to different members of the team. Each member will be responsible
		   for keeping the task up to date with information about how the task is being completed and should close the task 
		   when it is done. 
		</p>

		<p>You should show the professor your task breakdown.</p>
		
	<h2 id="Deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
	    <p>These are the requirements for grading for Project 0. <br>
			1.	Complete all of the tasks above. <br>
			2.	A running website on a service in AWS EC2 that is publicly available over your DNS address using HTTPS. <br>
			3.	Ansible playbook should be inside the group repository along with documentation on how to run the playbook. <br>
			4.	Complete documentation of all tasks performed. Documentation must be clear, concise and complete as to not 
				leave anything out. You should have the following documents in your infrastructure repository as a set of 
				markdown files. <br> 
		</p>
			<p style="margin-left:2%; margin-right:2%;">  
				a.	README.md for each repo giving basic information <br>
				b.	AWS setup <br>
				c.	AWS services setup (EC2, VPC, Route53, etc) <br>
				d.	AWS service diagram showing each aspect of the infrastructure <br>
			</p>
		<p>
			5.	Group presentation at the end of the project.
